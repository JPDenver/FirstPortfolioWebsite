      <h2>About Me</h2>   
      <p class = aboutMe>I really love doing things outdoors, especially mountain biking, and I also love a great challenge. I moved to Colorado from Illinois in 2012 just to do more competitve mountain biking. I was passionate about that for a long time but it's never really turned into a way to make a living, but that's ok, I love it too much to even think of it as work anyway.  I luckily discovered computer programming in 2019 as what I thought would just be a little hobby but my passion, knowledge, and curiosity has only grown and now I am eager to see what's possible with the right resources and people to collaborate with.  </p>
